    <h1>How to make Peanut Butter Cake</h1>
    <p> To craft this scrumptious Peanut Butter Cake, begin by preheating your oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and greasing and flouring two 9inch round baking pans. In a large mixing bowl, cream together 1 cup of creamy peanut butter and a half cup of butter until smooth. Gradually add in 4 cups of confectioners' sugar, beating well after each addition, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat in 4 eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Now, alternate adding 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 2 teaspoons of baking powder with 1 cup of milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, and mixing until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Once baked, allow the cake to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Serve slices of this delectable Peanut Butter Cake as is, or add a dollop of whipped cream or a drizzle of chocolate sauce for an extra touch of indulgence. Enjoy every moist, peanut buttery bite!</p>
